<strong> It Began In The Schau Studio </strong>
  <div class="box">
    <p> GMH pedals was founded in Vancouver B.C. by Grave Disorder Bass Guitarist Garth MacGregor Heslop and developed from input from a collaboration of journeyman guitarists that wanted to turn the thin, clean sound of their electrics into something wild and distorted. Garth manufactured his first protoype in his Yaletown condo with great demand from the local music scene and GMH pedals was born </p>

        <h2>Transparent Overdrive</h2>
  <p>The GMH Pedal Crunch Transparent Overdrive is a low-gain
overdrive pedal suitable for guitar and bass; it provides soft,
tube-like clipping while maintaining your core tone. Gain: This controls the amount of amplification in both gain
stages.<br>
Tone: A wide range control that works very much like the tone
pot on most electric guitars.<br>
Vol: This attenuates the amplified and clipped signal after it
leaves the tone filter.<br>
LED Brightness
As a player who occasionally plays daytime outdoor shows, I
wanted a super bright LED; however, this made it horrible to use
in any other situation. So, I added a variable resistor (trim pot) to
the side that allows you to vary the LED Brightness from dark
stage to bright sun. Please make the adjustment gently using a
jeweler’s screwdriver.</p>
